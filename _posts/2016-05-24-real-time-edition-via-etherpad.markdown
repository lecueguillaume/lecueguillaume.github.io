[Etherpad](http://etherpad.org) is a really-real time collaborative editor. Here is how I installed it and use it now. 


a) clone the repo :

> git clone https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git

b) enter the directory

> cd etherpad-lite/

c) run the run.sh 

> bash bin/run.sh

d) access your Etherpad at http://0.0.0.0:9001/ in your browser

e) Create a Pad by giving it a name 'new_pad'

f) share it with the address http://0.0.0.0:9001/p/new_pad
